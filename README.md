# GebDemo

This is a Grails app to aid in the learning of functional testing using Geb. All the dependencies and plugins are set up in the BuildConfig.groovy.

Important note: be sure to download the [chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.27/) to be able to run the functional tests in the app. You may need to change the path to your webdriver in the GebConfig.groovy class.
